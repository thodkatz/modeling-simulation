# Parameters estimation

The goal of these projects listed in this repository is to practice different methods for parameter estimation including **offline** and **online** or real-time techniques such as least squares for the first and gradient descent, lyapunov for the second.

## Directory structure

- In the `offline` directory, there is the implementation of the least square estimation for two given problems: mass-dumper-system and electrical circuits.
- In the `online` directory, we use the gradient descent and lyapunov methods for a given simple system.

**Matlab** is used for the implementation and for each directory, except the code, there is a short **report** (written in Greek) explaining the results and the analysis of each method.
